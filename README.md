# SearX-Theme

### Disclaimer

_I am not a professional programmer or designer. This is a small project that was made during my free time, therefore, this theme may be incomplete or contain rookie mistakes. I have tried as much as possible to make the best result._

## What is this?

A new and revamped theme for the metasearch engine [Searx](https://github.com/searx/searx), using [Stylebot](https://github.com/ankit/stylebot) (CSS). It is mainly focused for those who are just starting their migration from other services (Google, Bing, etc) and miss a friendly UI/UX.

## How to use it ? 

1. Install Stylebot in Firefox or Chrome

2. Download the Theme.json file from Github

3. Inside Stylebot open "Options", then "Sync" and finally "import". Import the previously downloaded file. Done! 

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does it work with public and private instances ?**

Yes, it does! Just make sure that the "Logicodev" theme is previously selected. 

**What doesn't work ?**

1. In firefox it might corrupt the theme and not look as good as it should. Feel free to fix it or improve it if that's the case.

2. In case some results come from several search engines, your tags might get out of the box (especially in your mobile version).
