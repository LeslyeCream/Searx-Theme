# SearX-Theme (Emerald)

### Disclaimer

_I am not a professional programmer or designer. This is a small project that was made during my free time, therefore, this theme may be incomplete or contain rookie mistakes. I have tried as much as possible to make the best result._

## What is this?

A new and revamped theme for the metasearch engine [Searx](https://github.com/searx/searx), using [Stylebot](https://github.com/ankit/stylebot) (CSS). It is mainly focused for those who are just starting their migration from other services (Google, Bing, etc) and miss a friendly UI/UX.

## Screenshots

## How to use it ? 

1. Install Stylebot in [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylebot-web/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha)

2. Download the [Theme.json](https://github.com/LeslyeCream/Searx-Theme/releases/tag/1.0) file from Github

3. Inside Stylebot open "Options", then "Sync" and finally "import". Import the previously downloaded file. Done! 

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does it work with public and private instances ?**

Yes, it does! Just make sure that the "Logicodev" theme is previously selected. If it doesn't work, you can replace the url inside the Stylebot settings. Or directly from the JSON file

**Can I use it from my phone?**

Currently it is only possible from some Chromium based browsers. Either kiwi Browser or Yandex Browser. Firefox does not allow to install any extensions yet. But since the theme is made with CSS it should basically work with any other extension that allows it. Stylish for example. 

**What doesn't work ?**

1. In firefox it might corrupt the theme and not look as good as it should. 

2. In case some results come from several search engines, your tags might get out of the box (especially in your mobile version or low resolution).

3. Minor color inconsistencies

4. SearX home page (the design is intended only when displaying results) 

5. The preferences button is not available

6. Some unknown details
